The person on the left is big, heavy, and has his feet firmly planted on the ground -- he is well able to absorb the force of the collision. The person on the right is small, light-weight, and has her feet off the ground. When the equal-sized force hits her, she flys back quickly because her momentum, and  her velocity, must make a big change in reaction to the force of the collision.\n",

Once they are broken, there is nothing to push against the train. With no force, Newton's First Law says the train will have to move in a straight line.
