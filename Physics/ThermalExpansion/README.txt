FOR TEACHERS:

- Target audience: Grade 11

- Related Curriculum Outcome: Physical Science 20-HT1 (SK Curriculum)
- Outcome summary: Analyze, qualitatively and quantitatively, the effect of heat on matter during temperature changes and changes of state using kinetic molecular theory. Explore, qualitatively and/or quantitatively, the expansion and contraction of matter during heat transfer or temperature change. (S, K). Investigate effects of the thermal expansion and contraction of matter in technological applications such as road, bridge and building design, plumbing, power line construction and industrial engineering. (STSE, A)

- This notebook can be used as either an introduction to thermal linear expansion or as a review.

- Students will encounter: a basic summary of kinetic molecular theory, interactive 3D-graphs of the expansion of materials, an experimental outlook of how to derive the coefficient of linear expansion as well as the thermal expansion formula, and a application of thermal expansion that will spark interest in many students.

- Expected time to complete the notebook: 1 - 2 class periods (60 - 90 min)
