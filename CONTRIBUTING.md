# Contributing Guidelines
Create a branch off of master for your task. After completing your notebook(s) and content review, make the recommended changes and open a pull request from your branch to master.

## Organization
If you have files accompanying your notebook they should be in a directory along with your notebook.
Images should all be in an `images` folder, with the exception of the [header](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-top.jpg?raw=true) and [footer](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-bottom.jpg?raw=true).

## Banners

The markdown to display the banner in the header should be

`![Callysto.ca Banner](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-top.jpg?raw=true)`

and in the footer

`[![Callysto.ca License](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-bottom.jpg?raw=true)](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/LICENSE.md)`

## Naming Conventions
Your notebook name should be kebab-case and it should not contain your Jira task identifier. 
If your notebook is in a directory, your directory should have the same name as your notebook but in UpperCamelCase. 
All files should have descriptive names.
