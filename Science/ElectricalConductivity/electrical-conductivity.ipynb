    "Electrical conductivity is based on the flow of electrons. Metals are good conductors of electricity because they allow electrons to flow through the entire piece of material. In comparison, distilled water is a very poor conductor of electricity since very little electricity flows through it. Dissolving ions in water changes this and allows electrons to travel through the solution. If the solution is able to conduct electricity, the current can be measured with a conductivity meter."
