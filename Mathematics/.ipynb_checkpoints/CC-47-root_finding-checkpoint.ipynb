This topic is introduced with the goal of easing you into numerical solutions to mathematical problems. We will outline the advantages and disadvantages of solving a problem numerically rather than analytically. At the end of the notebook there will be example problems from real-world scenarios, in which you have the opportunity to implement these methods, yielding a broader understanding of their applicability and power.\n",

Nevertheless, you will be encouraged to manipulate some of the lines in order to input a function of your choice, but that is all. The pieces of code and algorithms can be simply thought of as tools to execute the task you want them to perform, and only running them will be a necessary to accomplish this task. Although the coding isn't required, I strongly encourage you to try to understand how and why it works. "

We recommend converting the function into a form that you can graph in order to determine the behaviour on either side of the roots. Think about the possible forms of the graph, i.e. concavity, convexity, and what this tells you about the intervals where the function is positive.

    "   Below we will outline the differences, pros and cons and methods of analytic vs. numerical solutions within the context of root finding. By solving for the roots of the polynomial and analyzing the graph of the function, you were able to explicitly determine an answer to the question posed. This is the benefit of these analytic expressions; they give you a nice and clear explicit answer. It is often the case that we can derive analytic solutions to simpler, well-posed problems. Now, what if the problem is not so well-posed? What if our analytic approach becomes way too complex or tedious? How would you approach this problem without finding zeroes? What if the polynomial is of n-th order? For these cases we turn to a numerical approach, alleviating the work load and attaining the same end goal, but often with less accuracy.\n",

    "In order to answer the question, \"On what interval(s) is $ f(x) > 0?$\", you probably found the roots of the polynomial and looked at the behaviour of the graph inbetween these roots. This can be done for nice polynomials with integer coefficients and a low-order, but becomes increasingly difficult the more terms there are and the more nasty the polynomials starts looking. Nevertheless, your initial approach to this problem can still be taken; find the roots, analyze the behaviour in between these roots in order to determine where f(x) $>$ 0. Below we will discuss some algorithms used to determine roots of a polynomial.\n",
    "\n",

    "A great advantage of utilizing a numerical approach is that it allows for quick ways to make an approximate solution to a problem. This is useful if the amount of error is negligible and all one is looking for is an estimation. A quick way to get an estimation for our solution in question is simply to plot $f(x)$.

    "The bisection method is a simple algorithm to quickly find an approximation for a root. The basic idea of the method is to initially take an interval, $[a,b]$ on which the function is defined, such that $f(a),f(b)$ have different signs (so you know there is a root in between). We then split the interval in two and check the new endpoints of each subinterval. Let $c = (a+b)/2$ be the midpoint of the interval. If one of the subintervals has endpoints which have the same signs,i.e. if $f(a)$ & $f(c)$ or $f(b)$ & $f(c)$ have the same signs then this interval is discarded and the root is found in between the other interval. We then divide this sub-interval into two and perform the same analysis. Eventually, up to an accuracy we are happy with, we will have a small interval where we know a root is found. \n",
