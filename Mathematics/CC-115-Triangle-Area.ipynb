    "# Area of a Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Grade 7 Curriculum\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a notebook on how to calculate the area of a triangle. In this notebook, we will focus on how to calculate the area of any triangle. We will also learn how to find out the length of one variable, either base or height, while given the other variable and the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you understand how to find the area of a triangle, and give a few practice questions. This one notebook won’t be enough practice to master this skill, so be sure to do lots of practice!\n",

    "### What is a triangle?\n",
    "\n",
    "A triangle is defined as a 2D shape with 3 straight sides and 3 angles, which can take many forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "![picture](https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/xtypes-triangles-sides-angles.png.pagespeed.ic.LLzsGQR2vg.png) www.onlinemathlearning.com\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to find the area\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the area of a triangle seems a little trickier than finding the area of a rectangle, but there's an easy way to look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture below, a right angle triangle is created by cutting a rectangle diagonally in half. This makes two triangles with equal areas. We can see that the area of one triangle is half of the area of the rectangle. Since the area of a rectangle is $base \\times height$, the area of a triangle would be $\\frac{base \\times height}{2}$. Sometimes it’s written as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$, though they both mean the same thing. We will use the first formula to keep it simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "![picture2](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/g/area/area_right_triangl4.gif) www.homeschoolmath.net\n",
    "\n",
    "### What about non-right angle triangles?\n",
    "\n",
    "If non-right angle triangles aren't created out of rectangles, then how can we calculate their area?\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-right angled triangles aren't created out of cutting a rectangle, but we get another shape when they're doubled: a parallelogram! We know from the [Area of a Parallelogram notebook](Parallelogram_Area.ipynb) that a parallelogram has the same area formula as a rectangle. Now we can figure out the area of any triangle like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![animation with words](https://i.gifer.com/9VFS.gif) http://people.wku.edu/tom.richmond/triangle1.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create rectangles out of non-right angle triangles by moving the area around, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![animation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Triangle_area.gif) www.wikimedia.org\n",

If you want to learn a little bit about another way to calculate area, this time knowing the length of all three sides, but not the height, then look at the article on [Heron's formula](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/triangles/area/herons-formula-triangle-area.php) but you don't have to know this yet."

    "Let's review what we've learned in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The area of a triangle is half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height.\n",
    "- The formula is $Area = \\frac{base \\times height}{2}$\n",
    "- The formula works for all types of triangles as long as you know base and height.\n",
    "- The formula works for finding any variable that is missing by rearranging values on either side of the equals sign.\n",
    "- There's more than one way to calculate the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the time to learn this formula and how to fill it in. You may not always have the formula to read, but filling in and manipulating equations like this formula will be essential for many math skills in the future. As always in mathematics, the more you practice, the easier it gets!"
