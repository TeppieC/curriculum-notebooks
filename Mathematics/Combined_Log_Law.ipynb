    "## Introduction: <p>\n",
    "Logarithms are the opposite function of exponentials. Just like exponentials, the behavior of these functions can be categorized by 4 main laws that will be shown below.<p>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Basics of Logarithms:<p>\n",
    "Even though logarithms can seem very complex, we can look at the basic relationship between logarithms and exponentials in order to simplify these expressions to furture enhance our understandings. Before looking deeper in these relationships, we will first identify the main components of a logarithmic function. Logarithms are written in the following form:<p>\n",
    "$\\log_B(X)=N$ where B is the base of the logarithm. <p>\n",
    "We can solve for X with the following relationship:<p>\n",
    "$X=B^N$\n",

    "## Logarithmic Laws<p>\n",
    "There are 4 main logarithmic laws which help show the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. <p>\n",

    "## Background: Exponential Laws\n",
    "Since Logarithms are closely related with exponents, we will be uses exponential laws when deriving logarithmic laws. Exponential Laws state: <br />\n",

At any given x point, we can see that the sum of the 2 points on the right hand side are equal to the left hand side of the equation. The following code graphs the 3 functions and analysis the resulting y values at any given x location. Theoretically, the sum of the y values of the 2 functions on the right hand side of the equation should be equal to the value on the left hand side of this equation.

    "$\\log_{B}(M)=\\frac{\\log_N(M)}{\\log_N(B)}$ \n",
    "### Mathematical Proof\n",
    "$\\text{First we need to define a variable}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{Let }x=\\log_{B}(M)\\\\\n",
    "\\text{When converting this to exponents by using basic logarithmic properties, we get: }\\\\\n",

    "### Graphical Proof\n",
    "In order to further prove this law, we will graph both sides of the equation. The left side function $\\log_{B}(Mx)$ was graphed as well as the right side $\\frac{\\log_N(Mx)}{\\log_N(Bx)}$. As we can see, x is located in the log function while the base is moved into the function as well. This means when x is not equal to 1, the functions will not align. Thus, we can expect for the points on the graph are only equivalent when x=1. However, we can still show that regardless of the new base value, the functions should align when x=1."
