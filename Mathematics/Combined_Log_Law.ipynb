    "## Introduction: <p>\n",
    "Logarithms are the opposite operation of exponentials. Just like exponentials, the behavior of logarithms can be categorized by laws that will be shown below. The 4 main laws shall be proved in this program.<p>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Basics of Logarithms:<p>\n",
    "Even though logarithms can seem very complex, we can look at the basic relationship between logarithms and exponentials in order to simplify these expressions to furture enhance our understandings. Before looking deeper in these relationships, we will first identify the main components of a logarithmic function. Logarithms are written in the following form:<p>\n",
    "$\\log_B(X)=N$ where B is the base of the logarithm. <p>\n",
    "We can solve for X with the following relationship:<p>\n",
    "$X=B^N$\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Logarithmic Laws<p>\n",
    "There are 4 main logarithmic laws which help show the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Product Law: $\\log_{B}(M \\times N)=\\log_{B}(M)+\\log_{B}(N)$<br /> \n",
    "Quotient Law: $\\log_{B}\\big(\\frac{M}{N}\\big)=\\log_{B}(M)-\\log_{B}(N)$<br />\n",
    "Power Law: $\\log_{B}(M^R)=R\\log_B(M)$<br />\n",
    "Changing Base Rule: $\\log_{B}(M)=\\frac{\\log_N(M)}{\\log_N(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Exponential Laws\n",
    "Since Logarithms are closely related with exponents, we will be using exponential laws when deriving logarithmic laws. Exponential Laws state: <br />\n",
    "$x^M \\times x^N=x^{M+N} \\quad (1) $<br />\n",
    "$\\frac{x^M}{x^N}=x^{M-N} \\quad \\quad \\; \\;\\;\\,(2)$<br />\n",
    "$(x^M)^N=x^{MN} \\quad \\quad \\,(3)$<br />\n",
    "$(xy)^N=x^Ny^N \\quad \\quad \\,(4)$<br />\n",
    "We will be refering these laws throughout the program using the number in the brackets above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Python\n",
    "### Import\n",
    "We will start out by importing modules that we will be using throughout the code. Modules are bits of code that other people have written and distibuted in order to simplify other programs."

    "\n",
    "We will be using 2 main classes. One contains abstract methods in order to create a template for multiple graphs using the same format in order to prove the laws. The other class contains static methods in order to store functions which will be used for calculations for the graphical proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the first class, LorgarithmLaw, all of the variables and definitions are initiated but not defined. The class is given attributes so that a very similar format of code can be used for each graphical proof. This results in consistent graphs and easier to read code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second class, Logarithm, will be used to store functions for calculations to assist with graphical proofs throughout the program. This will make it easier to perform calculations with constantly changing variables. Each function is written as a static method. This means that the attributes and purpose of the functions stay the same. The only thing that is subject to change is the predefined variables that are input into the function. The class is called \"Logarithm\". In order to call these functions we will have to first identify the class then the function. For example, the first log function will be called by stating Logarithm.log.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commenting on Code\n",
    "When looking at the code, you will notice that there is a box made out of number signs. This is not part of the working code. They are comments to submerize the function of the static method. The first heading contains the second while \"@Args\" describes the inputed variables in the function and \"@Returns\" describes the output numbers after being passed through the function."

From the left side, we will graph $y=\\log_B(\\frac{Mx}{Nx})$ which reduces to $y=\\log_B(\\frac{M}{N})$. It is expected that at any given x-coordinate, the difference between the respected y coordinates on the right side should be equivalent to the corresponding point on the function from the left side of the equation. Theoretically, if this equality proves to be true at all x points, then Quotient Law is valid."

    "During the mathematical proof, we  used the relationship between logarithms and exponents as well as exponential laws in order to derive Quotient Law. When we look at the graphical proof, we can see that the functions on the right hand side both resemble very similar curves. On the left hand side of the law, we can see that the function remains as a constant number. This appears reasonable as the two curves appear to be a consistent distance apparent. From the combined evidence of the mathematical and graphical proofs, we can prove the accuracy of Quotient Laws.\n",

    "$\\text{Let } x=\\log_{B}(M^R)$ <br />\n",
    "From the basics of logarithms, the equivalent exponential form is: <br />\n",

Since they are theoretically be equivalent to each other, we can expect that the functions will be identical on the graph. If this is seen on the graph, we can validate Power Law."

    "The mathematical proof uses the relationship between logarithms and exponents in order to change the value of the base and thus derive the rule. When looking at the graph, we can see that it confirms the expected results. The functions meet when x is equal to 1 regardless of the newly selected base. By these 2 proofs, we can confirm the changing base rule."
