    "## Introduction: <p>\n",
    "Logarithms are the opposite function of exponentials. Just like exponentials, the behavior of these functions can be categorized by 4 main laws that will be shown below.<p>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Basics of Logarithms:<p>\n",
    "Even though logarithms can seem very complex, we can look at the basic relationship between logarithms and exponentials in order to simplify these expressions to furture enhance our understandings. Before looking deeper in these relationships, we will first identify the main components of a logarithmic function. Logarithms are written in the following form:<p>\n",
    "$\\log_B(X)=N$ where B is the base of the logarithm. <p>\n",
    "We can solve for X with the following relationship:<p>\n",
    "$X=B^N$\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Logarithmic Laws<p>\n",
    "There are 4 main logarithmic laws which help show the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Product Law: $\\log_{B}(M \\times N)=\\log_{B}(M)+\\log_{B}(N)$<br /> \n",
    "Quotient Law: $\\log_{B}\\big(\\frac{M}{N}\\big)=\\log_{B}(M)-\\log_{B}(N)$<br />\n",
    "Power Law: $\\log_{B}(M^R)=R\\log_B(M)$<br />\n",
    "Changing Base Rule: $\\log_{B}(M)=\\frac{\\log_N(M)}{\\log_N(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Exponential Laws\n",
    "Since Logarithms are closely related with exponents, we will be using exponential laws when deriving logarithmic laws. Exponential Laws state: <br />\n",
    "$x^M \\times x^N=x^{M+N} \\quad (1) $<br />\n",
    "$\\frac{x^M}{x^N}=x^{M-N} \\quad \\quad \\; \\;\\;\\,(2)$<br />\n",
    "$(x^M)^N=x^{MN} \\quad \\quad \\,(3)$<br />\n",
    "$(xy)^N=x^Ny^N \\quad \\quad \\,(4)$<br />\n",
    "We will be refering these laws throughout the program using the number in the brackets above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Python\n",
    "### Import\n",
    "We will start out by importing packages that we will be using later in the code. Packages are functions of code that other people have written in order to simplify other programs."

At any given x point, we can see that the sum of the 2 points on the right hand side are equal to the left hand side of the equation. The following code graphs the 3 functions and analysis the resulting y values at any given x location. Theoretically, the sum of the y values of the 2 functions on the right hand side of the equation should be equal to the value on the left hand side of this equation. Theoretically, if this is always the case, then Product Law is valid."
