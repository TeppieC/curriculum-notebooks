    "## Introduction: <p>\n",
    "Logarithms are the opposite function of exponentials. Just like exponentials, the behavior of these functions can be categorized by 4 main laws that will be shown below.<p>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Basics of Logarithms:<p>\n",
    "Even though logarithms can seem very complex, we can look at the basic relationship between logarithms and exponentials in order to simplify these expressions to furture enhance our understandings. Before looking deeper in these relationships, we will first identify the main components of a logarithmic function. Logarithms are written in the following form:<p>\n",
    "$\\log_B(X)=N$ where B is the base of the logarithm. <p>\n",
    "We can solve for X with the following relationship:<p>\n",
    "$X=B^N$\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Logarithmic Laws<p>\n",
    "There are 4 main logarithmic laws which help show the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Product Law: $\\log_{B}(M \\times N)=\\log_{B}(M)+\\log_{B}(N)$<br /> \n",
    "Quotient Law: $\\log_{B}\\big(\\frac{M}{N}\\big)=\\log_{B}(M)-\\log_{B}(N)$<br />\n",
    "Power Law: $\\log_{B}(M^R)=R\\log_B(M)$<br />\n",
    "Changing Base Rule: $\\log_{B}(M)=\\frac{\\log_N(M)}{\\log_N(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Exponential Laws\n",
    "Since Logarithms are closely related with exponents, we will be using exponential laws when deriving logarithmic laws. Exponential Laws state: <br />\n",
    "$x^M \\times x^N=x^{M+N} \\quad (1) $<br />\n",
    "$\\frac{x^M}{x^N}=x^{M-N} \\quad \\quad \\; \\;\\;\\,(2)$<br />\n",
    "$(x^M)^N=x^{MN} \\quad \\quad \\,(3)$<br />\n",
    "$(xy)^N=x^Ny^N \\quad \\quad \\,(4)$<br />\n",
    "We will be refering these laws throughout the program using the number in the brackets above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Python\n",
    "### Import\n",
    "We will start out by importing packages that we will be using later in the code. Packages are functions of code that other people have written in order to simplify other programs."

    "In python we can make definition statements at the to be refered to throughout the code. In this case, we will be defining logarithmic functions at the beginning of the code to use when plotting multiple points on graphs throughout the code. Each definition requires input values to preform calculations. The inputed values are commented within each of the definitions while the outputted values will be used throughout the code to assist with graphical proofs. These definitions are placed inside a class called logarithms which is comparable to a folder to contain the definitions. This method prevents these functions from overlapping with built-in functions."

This includes the functions both on the left and right hand side of the equation for Product Law. At any given x point, we can see that the sum of the 2 points on the right hand side are equal to the left hand side of the equation. The following code graphs the 3 functions and analysis the resulting y values at any given x location. Theoretically, the sum of the y values of the 2 functions on the right hand side of the equation should be equal to the value on the left hand side of this equation. Theoretically, if this is always the case, then Product Law is valid."

When we look at the graphical proof, we can see that the functions on the right hand side both resemble very similar curves. On the left hand side of the law, we can see that the function remains as a constant number. This appears reasonable as the two curves appear to be a consistent distance apparent. From the combined evidence of the mathematical and graphical proofs, we can prove the accuracy of Quotient Laws.\n",
