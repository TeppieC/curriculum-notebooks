    "## Probability and Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first start with some definitions. Having a clear understanding of these definitions will help with the rest of the notebook, as these concepts will be used often. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Event**: An outcome of an experiment. These are the outcomes that are possible. For example, when rolling a die, possible events are the die landing on the numbers $1-6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability**: The likelihood for an event to occur. In a very large amount of trials, it is the fraction of times you expect the event to happen. This is expressed as a number between $0$ and $1$, with $1$ being $100$% likelihood. For example, after a large number of coin flips you would expect a properly weighted coin to land on heads half of the time. Therefore the probability of said event is $0.5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Odds**: The odds of an event $X$ are typically expressed as a ratio $X$ to $Y$. This is typically expressed as the ratio between the probability that the event will occur and the probability that it will not occur. For example, what are the odds of rolling a $1$ for a fair die? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well the probability of rolling a $1$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$ and the probability of not rolling a $6$ is $1-\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$ . Therefore the odds are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\frac{1}{6}:\\frac{5}{6} = 1:5\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Anytime you would like to express the probability of an event *not* happening, this is given by $1-p$, where $p$ is the probability of the event occuring. It will be found useful to think in the negatory sometimes. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Different types of Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Odds against**: This happens when the probability of the event not happening are higher than the event happening. Odds against are expressed with the larger number first. For example, the *odds against* rolling a 1 on a fair dice are 5:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Odds on**: These are the opposite of odds against, i.e the probability of the event happening are greater than it not happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Even odds**: This occurs when the probability of an event happening are the same it not. For example, tossing a fair coin as an even odds of landing on heads or tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependent vs. Independent Events\n",
    "\n",
    "An independent event is one that, if it occurs, it does not influence the likelihood of any other event happening. For example, tossing a coin. The fact that one coin toss lands on heads does not affect the probability of the next coin toss. Conversely, dependent events change the future probability of other one occuring. The most classic example is pulling cards at random from a deck of cards. If you take a card out, and don't put it back in, then there are now less cards in the deck. If you pulled an ace of spades from a standard deck of cards, with probability $\\frac{1}[52}$, the probability of pulling an ace of hearts is now $\\frac{1}{51}$ . The first event, namely pulling a card at random *and not replacing it*, influenced the probability of the next card being pulled. When evaluating probabilistic statements, it is important to consider whether or not the events are dependent or independent.\n",

    "    \n",
    "These two schools of probabilistic reasoning are at the foundation of modern probability theory. Since you are not taking a course in probability theory, we won't delve too deep into these subjects. Nevertheless, understanding their basic principles will assist you greatly in evaluating the validity of statements about odds and probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequentist School**:\n",
    "The frequentist approach to probability emphasizes large amounts of data to assess and determine probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian School**:\n",
    "The Bayesian approach, named after the 18th century Reverend Thomas Bayes, employs the use of conditional probabilities. They also look at large amounts of data, but also want to consider the conditional probabilities, which are the likelihoods of a certain event occuring in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's easiest to understand their differences through an example. Say you have a bird feeder hung from a stand which keeps track of how many and what type of birds come to feed. At some point, it is noted that 2 Emperor Penguins have come to feed. If there were $N$ birds over 1 day, the frequentist would be inclined to say that there is a $\\frac{2}{N}$ probability that an Emperor Penguin will fly up to the bird feeder in a day. The Bayesian, with their conditional probabilities, disagrees. The Bayesian, who knows beforehand the percentage of all the birds in Canada that are flying Emperor Penguins which happens to be very small (some might say $0$), says this is an incredibly rare event. By considering a prior probability, the probability that a bird is a flying emperor penguin, the Bayesian drew a more educated conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you make up your mind about which approach is better to think about probability, we note a couple very important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What if the conditional probabilities are incorrect? Where did the Bayesian get their data from? What were the methods used, were they biased? The Bayesian, with their prior knowledge, can sometimes unknowingly introduce biases and thus making the interpretation of the probability values somewhat subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Frequentist relies solely upon the data collected and thus remains as unbiased as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to understand the pros and cons of each school of thought. Using one approach or the other can be useful based on the context of the problem and data set.  "
