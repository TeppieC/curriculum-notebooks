    "**Event**: An outcome of an experiment. These are the outcomes that are possible. For example, when rolling a die, possible events are the die landing on the numbers $1-6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability**: The likelihood for an event to occur. In a very large amount of trials, it is the fraction of times you expect the event to happen. This is expressed as a number between $0$ and $1$, with $1$ being $100$% likelihood. For example, after a large number of coin flips you would expect a properly weighted coin to land on heads half of the time. Therefore the probability of said event is $0.5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Odds**: The odds of an event $X$ are typically expressed as a ratio $X$ to $Y$. This is typically expressed as the ratio between the probability that the event will occur and the probability that it will not occur. For example, what are the odds of rolling a $1$ for a fair die? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well the probability of rolling a $1$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$ and the probability of not rolling a 6 is $1-\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$ . Therefore the odds are:\n",

    "\\frac{1}{6}:\\frac{5}{6} = 1:5\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**: Anytime you would like to express the probability of an event *not* happening, this is given by 1-P, where P is the probability of the event occuring. It will be found useful to think in the negatory sometimes. "
