    "In this notebook you will gain an understanding of basic root-finding algorithms and their implementation. This topic is introduced with the goal of easing you into numerical solutions to mathematical problems. We will outline the advantages and disadvantages of solving a problem numerically rather than analytically. At the end of the notebook there will be example problems from real-world scenarios, in which you have the opportunity to implement these methods, yielding a broader understanding of their applicability and power.\n",

    "- Rudimentary algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook you will see examples of code to perform some basic root-finding algorithms. You will not be required to know how the code works or need to write any yourself. Nevertheless, you will be encouraged to manipulate some of the lines in order to input a function of your choice, but that is all. The pieces of code and algorithms can be simply thought of as tools to execute the task you want them to perform, and only running them will be a necessary to accomplish this task. Although the coding isn't required, I strongly encourage you to try to understand how and why it works. "

A first approach to this problem would be to find the roots of the polynomial and then analyze the behaviour in between these roots. We recommend converting the function into a form that you can graph in order to determine the behaviour on either side of the roots. Think about the possible forms of the graph, i.e. concavity, convexity, and what this tells you about the intervals where the function is positive. This type of analytical thinking will help further along in the notebook. </br>\n",

    "   Below we will outline the differences, pros and cons and methods of analytic vs. numerical solutions within the context of root finding. By solving for the roots of the polynomial and analyzing the graph of the function, you were able to explicitly determine an answer to the question posed. This is the benefit of these analytic expressions; they give you a nice and clear explicit answer. It is often the case that we can derive analytic solutions to simpler, well-posed problems. Now, what if the problem is not so well-posed? What if our analytic approach becomes way too complex or tedious? How would you approach this problem without finding zeroes? What if the polynomial is of n-th order? For these cases we turn to a numerical approach, alleviating the work load and attaining the same end goal, but often with less accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Next we will walk you through different ways to approach this problem, and more complex problems of the same flavour, numerically. You will gain some insight into the implementation and benefit of numerical solutions while developing some basic skills in Python and numerical analysis.\n",

    "In order to answer the question, \"On what interval(s) is $ f(x) > 0?$\", you probably found the roots of the polynomial and looked at the behaviour of the graph inbetween these roots. This can be done for nice polynomials with integer coefficients and a low-order, but becomes increasingly difficult the more terms there are and the more nasty the polynomials starts looking. Nevertheless, your initial approach to this problem can still be taken; find the roots, analyze the behaviour in between these roots in order to determine where f(x) $>$ 0. Below we will discuss some algorithms used to determine roots of a polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for instance, the polynomial:\n",
    "$f(x) = x^3 -\\frac{7}{9}x^2 - \\frac{1}{4}x+\\frac{7}{36}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A great advantage of utilizing a numerical approach is that it allows for quick ways to approximate a solution. This is useful if the amount of error is negligible and all one is looking for is an estimation. A quick way to get an estimation for our solution in question is simply to plot $f(x)$. This is similar to what you would do on your graphing calculator, now just on the computer using code! If you would like to get started plotting with python, the best place to start is with matplotlib. It's quick to learn, if you know basic python syntax, and there are tons of internet resources to explore its capabilities and debug problems. For extensive documentation and functionality of the matplotlib library see https://matplotlib.org/. Click on plot function to inspect $f(x)$ above.\n"

    "The bisection method is a simple algorithm to quickly find an approximation for a root. The basic idea of the method is to initially take an interval, $[a,b]$ on which the function is defined, such that $f(a),f(b)$ have different signs (so you know there is a root in between). We then split the interval in two and check the new endpoints of each subinterval. Let $c = (a+b)/2$ be the midpoint of the interval. If one of the subintervals has endpoints which have the same signs,i.e. if $f(a)$ & $f(c)$ or $f(b)$ & $f(c)$ have the same signs then this interval is discarded and the root is found in between the other interval. We then divide this sub-interval into two and perform the same analysis. Eventually, up to an accuracy we are happy with, we will have a small interval where we know a root is found. \n",

    "The algorithm to implement the secant method is given as follows. \n",

    "#same function as for the bisection method\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return x**3 - (7/9)*x**2 -(1/4)*x + 7/36  #Function to employ algorithm on\n",

    "The statement \n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1,n):\n",
    "```\n",
    "also deserves some unpacking. This is another essential programming tool known as the for loop. Within the `for` statement, the indented code block is executed, then the next iteration of the loop is performed, in our case $i \\mapsto i+1$, and this continues until all iterations are done ($i = n$). It provides a means of counting or iterating through a process. In our case these are the iterations through the secant method algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The `print(x1)` statement is outside of the indented block. This means that x1 is printed after the loop has finished. If the statement were included within the block, then x1 would be every time. How many times would x1 be printed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a visualization of the algorithm at work. Input the initial values of $x_0, x_1$ below and press \"Iterate\" to see how the algorithm searches for the roots of the same function used in the \"Inspection\" example. This will give you a sense how this algorithm works and the problems it may run into. Reset the cell by pressing restart and playing around with different initial conditions to gain a better sense of how the algorithm works. Does it seem faster than the bisection method? How many iterations until it converged to the solution with the accuracy you wanted? Did it even converge? Notice how different sets of initial conditions can make the algorithm converge to different roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try working through the algorithm analytically, on paper with a function of your choice, beforehand. See how fast you can obtain a root and to what accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "A transcendental equation is defined as an equation which contains a transcendental function of the variable being solved for. \n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- $x = e^x$\n",
    "- $\\tan(x) = x$\n",
    "- $\\ln(x) = e^x$\n",

    "These equations may look intimidating, but by formulating their solution as a root finding problem and applying the methods we learned in this notebook, they become solvable. Developing these tools and being exposed to these types of problems will aid you if you are ever faced with an equation of this type in the future. \n",

    "Find all solutions of the equation: $\\cos(x) = x$\n",

    "Firstly, the problem can be formulated as: find the roots of $f(x) = \\cos(x) - x$ (Why are these equivalent?). Let's first apply Inspection in order to get a sense of what this function looks like and where it may have roots/solutions. The next cell plots the function on a grid so we can visually \"inspect\" where the root is approximately. Use the interactivity function 'zoom' to see where the function crosses the x-axis more precisely.\n"

    "We see that this function crosses the x-axis many times, actually infinitely many times (if we were to extend the plot). Our Bisection Method algorithm can only narrow down on one root at a time. With appropriate guesses for the initial conditions, we would be able to obtain all roots (in theory) but this would be a tedious task. It took a combination of these methods to recognize that there were multiple solutions and obtain their exact values. \n",

The answers are all integer values so you do not need to worry about accuracy too much. Additionally, consider these transcendental equations. You may run into some problems (technical and theoretical) solving them, this is OK and all part of the learning process. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook you learned the basics of root-finding algorithms. Namely, we studied the process of finding and approximating the roots of a function by Inspection, the Bisection Method,and the Secant Method. Equally as important, you gained some experience and exposure (if you haven't seen some already) to scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we applied our methods within the context of solving transcendental equations. It is likely that this is the first time you have been exposed to transcendental equations and the methods we have discussed here. Hopefully, working through the notebook helped you understand the different ways in which one can break down a problem like this. Which did you like best? Being able to adapt and apply the mathematical tools that you have acquired in class is an invaluable skill to have. These skills often end up transferring to general problem-solving skills. I encourage you to reflect upon which of the methods you enjoyed and why. It will offer insight into your own personal learning process.\n"
