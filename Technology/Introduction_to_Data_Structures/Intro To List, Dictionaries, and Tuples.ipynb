    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A **List** is a data type in Python. More specifically, a list is what is known as a **linear data structure**. That is, all elements in the list are orginized in a linear order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like a string, you can access individual elements, add elements, remove elements, copy a list, etc. However, the crucial difference between a string and a list is that lists can hold multiple data types at once, whereas strings can only hold characters. Items inside a list are called **elements** and each element has an **index** starting from 0 to the length of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a list in Python, we simply enclose our items in square brackets. For example, if we type:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "we will have created a list of elements numbered 1 to 10. Here is a list with multiple data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "[True, False, \"Hello\", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'a','b','c']\n",
    "\n",
    "Like strings, we can pass lists to the print function as a whole list, or we can specify what elements to print by providing index locations."
