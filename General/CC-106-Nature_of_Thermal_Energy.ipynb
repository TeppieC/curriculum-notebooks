Since the contents are warmer than thermos itself, they will exchange heat to the body of the thermos. We want the thermos to have a low thermal conductivity so it does not easily exchange heat with its environment, therefore preserving the Temperature of its contents.

    "Heat transfer via **convection** occurs due to the movement of molecules in a fluid (gas or liquid). Personally, I tend to think of heat transfer in terms of convection. Since it involves the flow of a gas or liquid from a warmer to a colder temperature within the fluid, I believe it is the most intuitive to visualize. Convection does not occur in solid materials because the molecules that make up a solid do not have the ability to flow; this is what makes a solid a solid. Not unlike conduction, convection occurs from the flow a heat energy due a temperature difference within a fluid. The hotter fluid flows to regions where the fluid is cooler. It is the process which governs the currents in our oceans and the movement of air in our atmosphere. Our understanding of convection has helped us understand how to forecast the weather and even how energy is transported within the sun! Below is an illustrative graphic of this phenomenon in the mantle of the earth. \n",

    "If we consider a particle model of matter, the fluid moves due to changes in **kinetic energy** of the particles in the fluid. The hotter regions in the fluid, the ones with more heat energy, have more \"excited\" particles that are colliding into one another more frequently. These regions are less **dense** than the colder regions. In the colder regions, the particles are colliding into one another less frequently, thus these regions are more dense. The more dense regions in the fluid will sink, allowing for the hotter regions to rise. Convection is the reason why \"heat rises\". \n",

The air cools on its ascent, causing the moisture to condense. Condensation is the transition from gaseous to liquid state. If the air is instable enough, this process can occur for a longer time. This results in the formation of \"cumulonimbus clouds\", which are those very tall pillowy clouds which have the ability to produce thunder and lightning. Given enough moisture, instability in the air and convection (heat transfer), a thuderstorm is likely to occur. \n",

    "Radiation is our third and final form of heat transfer that we will discuss. Heat transfer via radiation occurs in all matter that has a temperature above absolute 0 (0 Kelvin). This occurs from a conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy. Energy is \"radiated\" away from a body in the form of electromagnetic radiation, in other words \"light\" emanating from a hot object. This light varies in wavelength and is dependent on the temperature of the body; hotter objects emit radiation at shorter wavelengths that carry higher energy. For example, in a fire, you may have heard how the blue part of a fire is hotter than the red part. This is true and is due to the fact that blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, and since the wavelength is dependent on the temperature of the material emmitting it, the blue portion of a fire is hotter. \n",
