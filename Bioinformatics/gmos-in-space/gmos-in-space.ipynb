Before sending you off to space, your team gave you a variety of crop seeds and a data set containing information on them, including some biological traits that were designed to give them an edge in this new environment. \n",

As part of this mission, you will be asked to convince the other astronauts to explain your reasoning using computational thinking and learn data science skills. \n",
